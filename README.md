# Tachi for Simply Love (ITGMania)

**THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON ITGMANIA. IT WILL NOT WORK FOR OTHER CLIENTS. THIS WILL NOT BE PORTED TO OTHER CLIENTS.**

Tachi for Simply Love provides [Tachi](https://github.com/TNG-Dev/Tachi) integration inside ITGMania.

At the moment, it only does the bare minimum: Listens for when you get a score and sends it to the server.

## Usage

Download [Tachi.lua] and place it inside `Themes/Simply Love/Modules`.

If you're using this with [Bokutachi](https://bokutachi.xyz), use `Import Scores > ITG > ITG Hook` to get your configuration file.

Place your `Tachi.json` file next to `Groovestats.ini`.

Scores should now automatically submit on-achieved!
